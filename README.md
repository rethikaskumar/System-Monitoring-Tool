# System-Monitoring-Tool

Our project is an attempt to create a performance optimization tool that is based on Windows OS. The application aims to display CPU  and RAM usage information in the form of graphs, to ease user interaction.
The application also automatically updates the graphs every second. The application logs each process’s CPU and RAM usage over a period of time and produces a short list of processes that are essentially reducing the performance of the system . To help optimize the performance of the system, the user is given an option to forcefully terminate such processes. The user is also given an option to clear the “Temp” files present in the C drive since accumulation of files in this folder has proven to make the system inefficient. 
	
The application will consist of an interactive GUI which will provide the user with information regarding the number of processes that are currently being executed, their CPU usage etc .
The GUI is to be implemented using tkinter, and the performance specifications will be visualized using libraries like matplotlib.
